# Overview

This is a simple project that allows you to generate resonance particles using Tsallis distribution for momentum and spherical symmetry distribution for angles and calculate momentum of daughter particles. After that you can restore resonance (one or multile at the same time) mass in different decay channels. 

This programm is mainly used for applying cuts for real data analysis.
